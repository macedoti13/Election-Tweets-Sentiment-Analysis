## Project Overview <a name="overview"><a/>
**The project is composed of building a machine learning model in order to classify the tweets generated during the 2022 brazillian elections. The tweets are either a compliment for a given candidate or a curse. The model's job is to correctly classify a given tweet into one of these two categories.**
